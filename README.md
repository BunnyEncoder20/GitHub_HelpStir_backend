# GitHub_HelpStir_backend

- Todo App Backend Project Made for the HelpStir Backend Intern Position Qualification round

---

## Installations 

The most important thing for any good backend, is to have **proper structure and set up** before proceeding to add anything to code the actual project.

1. Initializing Project
```
npm init
```

2. Express package
```
npm install express
```

3. Nodemon (installed as a dev dependency)
```
npm install nodemon -D
```

4. dotenv
```
npm i dotenv
```

5. CORS package
```
npm install cors
```
- For allowing Cross Origin Requests. 
- For now, allowing all cross-origin request, but can whitelist only some, using cors config options.
- **Though not requried** for the *just* backend, it's part of the backend structure and init configurations.
